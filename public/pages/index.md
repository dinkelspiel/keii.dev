# about

I'm a Swedish computer science student who has a philosophy of learning atleast one new technology or tool for each project I make so that I always have something new to work on. 
I hate the feeling of being bored or having nothing to do and thats why I always have a project to work on and if you're interested in my "finished" projects then you can always looks in <a href="/projects">/projects</a>.
